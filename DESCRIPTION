Description: A feasible framework for mutation analysis and reverse transcription 
  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay evaluation of COVID-19, including 
  mutation profile visualization, statistics and mutation ratio of each assay. 
  The mutation ratio is conducive to evaluating the coverage of RT-PCR assays in 
  large-sized samples. Mercatelli, D.; Giorgi, F.M.(2015)
